# Peril: Know your favorite color. Or else.
Peril is a collaborative notebook editor and networked UNIX shell. It's
designed to replace bash, tools like Jupyter, and various ad-hoc workflows
involving `ssh` and `rsync`. Peril can install itself on any system running
Perl >=5.8.0 without writing data to the filesystem; once installed, that
system will become a node in your VPN and all of its resources will be visible.

## Installation
```sh
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spencertipping/peril/master/peril | perl -
```
